This revolting excuse for a repo is the filthy dwelling of the source code and assets for my Discord Jam 5 game. You can subject yourself to the agony of playing it [here](https://arbe.itch.io/sow-saw), or make the correct choice and just go along with your day.

Thanks and kisses to Bloongi for doing the SFX and boppin' tunes :kiss:
